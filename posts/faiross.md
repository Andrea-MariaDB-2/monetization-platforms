FairOSS is a public benefit corporation with a mission to sustain the production and maintenance of freely shareable intellectual property. Using a community first approach, FairOSS is assembling a coalition of open source producers, consumers, and business and technology partners towards building the Groundwater program, a framework for sustainability.  FairOSS arranges equity and revenue financing with organizations benefiting from open source and allows them a way to broadcast their social responsibility through the use of FairOSS trademarks.  Funds raised by these activities are used to fund open source projects.

FairOSS also offers membership programs designed to bootstrap the company, expand board level decision making, and build the foundations for membership benefits. <!--more-->
